# BotComplexity
Twitter bot that tweets when a researcher I'm interested in publishes a new paper

Replace your keys in the create_api() function, as well as paths to an authors.csv file (one line per author). pubs.csv holds the pubIDs of previously tweeted papers, so we don't get repeats. You can initialize pubs.csv by running initialize.py file (if you don't, it will tweet every paper they've ever published on the first run!).
