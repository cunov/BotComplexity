# BotComplexity
Twitter bot that tweets when a researcher I'm interested in publishes a new paper

Replace your keys in the create_api() function, as well as paths to an authors.csv file (one line per author). You can initialize pubs.csv by running initialize.py after creating your authors.csv file. If you don't, it will tweet every paper they've ever published on the first run!
